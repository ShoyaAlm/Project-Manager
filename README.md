# Project-Manager
This is a Persian Project Management Web Application, and it is a clone from the Trello Web App

When you first run the program, you must either login, or sign up if you haven't already, by clicking on the green button from up top of the front-page of the web app.

Once you signup/login, then you have a page called 'Workspace', which illustrates all the boards that you have created listed above, or the boards that were created by any user other than you, which are listed just below the ones you have made.

you can also delete your boards from here by clicking on the red button.


this is an example of a 'Board', which includes 'Lists' and those lists include 'Cards' inside of them.

we can also see that each card inside a list has a color attached to them, and that's basically their label.
also every card has a starting date and a due date, which members of a card can modify anytime they want.



there's a drag-&-drop feature that I have added to this web app.

By writing the name of the new list that I want to create over here, we can add a new list to our board.

[AddNewListVid]


We can also add cards to that newly created list.

When we click on a card we are led to this section
